# python-ffmpeg

This library is an effort to make some python wrappers for ffmpeg

To set up the development environment, use Vagrant:  
[https://www.vagrantup.com/](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

in the current directory, enter:  
```vagrant up```  

once it's up:  
```vagrant ssh```  
to start a session

Then, in the centos box, run:  
```sudo setup.sh```  
the first time to install the prerequisites (installing ffmpeg from source takes a little while)
